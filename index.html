<h2>Hey guys,</h2>

<p class="text1">This week we’ll be discussing the concept of <strong>"Youtubability"</strong> - </br> </p>
<p class="text2">another important game guideline.</p>

<section class="section-1">
    
    <div class="text-section1">
    <h3 class="h3-section1">Youtubability</h3>
    
    <p class="p-section1">
    </br>  
A key driver of youtubability is <strong>the clarity
of your gameplay</strong> to a potential player.
</br>
</br>
Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the
full potential of your game by working on
getting <strong>the lowest possible CPIs</strong> for your
games.
</br>
</br>
Many elements can be used to make your
game clearer :
</br>
</br>
For instance, ask yourself if a user’s interaction
with the game is <strong>evident,</strong> for
example, can she tell which character she
<strong>controls?</strong> Is the <strong>objective clear?</strong> Does it
look <strong>fun to play?</strong> Has she understood the
game after 1 second (great!) or after 10
seconds (too long!).
</br>
</br>
Make sure to <strong>use colours</strong> to help indicate
the gameplay rules. For instance, in Helix
Jump, obstacles are <strong>clearly contrasted</strong> (in
orange here) and instantly recognized as
a threat.
