<h2>Hey guys,</h2>

<p class="text1">This week we’ll be discussing the concept of <strong>"Youtubability"</strong> - </br> </p>
<p class="text2">another important game guideline.</p>

<section class="section-1">
    
    <div class="text-section1">
    <h3>Youtubability</h3>
    
    <p>
    </br>  
A key driver of youtubability is <strong>the clarity
of your gameplay</strong> to a potential player.
</br>
</br>
Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the
full potential of your game by working on
getting <strong>the lowest possible CPIs</strong> for your
games.
</br>
</br>
Many elements can be used to make your
game clearer :
</br>
</br>
For instance, ask yourself if a user’s interaction
with the game is <strong>evident,</strong> for
example, can she tell which character she
<strong>controls?</strong> Is the <strong>objective clear?</strong> Does it
look <strong>fun to play?</strong> Has she understood the
game after 1 second (great!) or after 10
seconds (too long!).
</br>
</br>
Make sure to <strong>use colours</strong> to help indicate
the gameplay rules. For instance, in Helix
Jump, obstacles are <strong>clearly contrasted</strong> (in
orange here) and instantly recognized as
a threat.

    <p>

If you want to run user tests with
</br> 
friends and family or even random
</br> 
people in the street, it is interesting to 
</br>
show them the 30 second video before
</br> 
making them try to prototype in order 
</br>
to <strong>understand their</strong> expectations from 
</br>
the video vs. the actual game they try.
</br>
</br>
<strong>Make it obvious</strong> with visual elements 
</br>
that help <strong>understand the objective and
</br>    
controls</strong> of the game, like with the
</br>
target used in Viatcheslav Tarasov’s 
</br>
Purple Diver or Fabrika Games’ Draw 
</br>
Car with the space dedicated to 
</br>
drawing.

<section class="section-4">
  <p>
    People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games <strong>on their </br>
    phone’s Facebook feed</strong>, everything will seem smaller than when </br>
    displayed in Unity or as a video on your computer screen. <strong>You should </br>
    also consider whether your gameplay video is understandable if </br>
    someone watches it on a small screen.</strong> With an average watch time of 3 </br>
    to 5 seconds, this is an accelerated elevator pitch!
    </br>
    </br>
    Think of the moment when you decide to click on a random video on </br>
    YouTube just because it has an attractive thumbnail - it’s the same idea </br>
    for your game videos.
